I built a tool that:

 Translates Chinese feedback into English

 Classifies it as Complaint, Praise, Suggestion, or Neutral

 Summarizes results with a chart + downloadable CSV

Example:

 原文: 这个功能太复杂了

 翻译: This feature is too complicated

 分类: Complaint (92%)

Why this matters:

 Instead of spending hours reading and translating reviews, teams can instantly spot trends and take action.

Built with Gradio + Hugging Face, this project bridges the gap between multilingual customers and global product teams.

What language or category should I add next? TO use the model use this link here   https://97f7b8f2800dc916fa.gradio.live , but the link expires after one week then you wont be able to access the model
